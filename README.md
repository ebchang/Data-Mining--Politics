# Description
This is a repo that demonstrates three algorithms in use to analyze a political data.
  - Apriori 
  - Decision Trees
  - Naive bayes

I have separated the different algorithm scripts into separate folders with corresponding README files.
The data to run the Decision Trees and Naive Bayes algorithms can be find in the _Data_for_DT_NB_ folder.
